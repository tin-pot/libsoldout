.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lus_attr_escape
and
.Fn lus_body_escape
functions escape all problematic characters in (X)HTML:
.Sq < ,
.Sq > ,
.Sq & ,
.Sq \(dq ;
and
.Sq < ,
.Sq > ,
.Sq &
respectively.
They accept a string
.Va str
of the length
.Va len
and output into
.Va ob
buffer.
.Pp
All provided renderers come with two flavors,
.Dq _html
producing HTML code (self-closing tags are rendered like this: <hr>),
and
.Dq _xhtml
producing XHTML code (self-closing tags like <hr />).
.Pp
.Va mkd_html
and
.Va mkd_xhtml
implement standard markdown to (X)HTML translation without any extensions.
.Pp
.Va discount_html
and
.Va discount_xhtml
implement on top of the standard markdown some of the extensions
found in Discount plus PHP-Markdown-like tables.
Here is a list of all extensions included in these renderers:
.Bl -bullet -width 1m
.It
image size specification, by appending
.Do =(width)x(height) Dc to the link
.It
pseudo-protocols in links:
.Bl -bullet -width 1m

.Do abbr:description Dc for <abbr title="description">...</abbr>
.It

.It
.Do id:name Dc for <span id="name">...</span>
.It
.Do raw:text Dc for verbatim unprocessed text inclusion
.El
.It
class blocks: blockquotes beginning with
.Do %class% Dc will be rendered as a div of the given class(es)
.El
.Pp
.Va nat_html
and
.Va nat_xhtml
implement on top of the Discount extensions Natasha's own extensions.
Here is a list of these extensions:
.Bl -bullet -width 1m
.It
id attribute for headers, using the syntax
.Dq id#Header text
.It
class attribute for paragraphs, by putting class name(s)
between parenthesis at the very beginning of the paragraph
.It
<ins> and <del> spans, using respectively
.Do ++ Dc and Do -- Dc
as delimiters (with emphasis-like restrictions,
i.e. an opening delimiter cannot be followed by a whitespace,
and a closing delimiter cannot be preceded by a whitespace)
.It
plain <span> without attribute, using emphasis-like delimiter
